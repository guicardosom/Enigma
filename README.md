# Enigma
A program that simulates the operation of the Enigma machine, which was used by the German military to encrypt messages during World War II.

This project was one of the five projects chosen for the “Nifty Assignments” workshop at the 2023 SIGCSE (Special Interest Group, Computer Science Education) Conference held in Toronto on March 5-8, 2023. The project was developed by professors Eric Roberts and Jeff Rembold of Willamette University in Salem, Oregon.
